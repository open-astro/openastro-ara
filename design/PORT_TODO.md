# OpenAstro Ara — Port TODO log

Append-only list of every `TODO(port)` and `PORT_BLOCKED` left in the codebase during the port, grouped by phase. Also tracks out-of-scope CodeRabbit suggestions deferred for follow-up.

Per PORT_PLAYBOOK.md §0 rule 4 (`Cite when stuck`): when you cannot translate a construct, leave a `// TODO(port): <one sentence>` and a placeholder that compiles, log it here, and move on. Sweep in Phase 15.

Per §0 rule 6 + §15 step 7 + COMMIT-PR-RULES.md CodeRabbit rule "out-of-scope suggestions": when CR suggests a broader refactor or future feature, log it here with the PR reference and reply "Acknowledged — tracked in design/PORT_TODO.md for follow-up".

## Phase 0.5a — Fork hygiene / WPF demolition

### Cascade scrubs

- ✅ `NINA.Equipment.csproj` ProjectReferences to nikoncswrapper + NINA.MGEN — scrubbed in Phase 0.5b
- ✅ `NINA.Test.csproj` ProjectReferences to NINA.MGEN + NINA.Plugin + NINA.CustomControlLibrary + NINA.WPF.Base + NINA — scrubbed in Phase 0.5b
- ✅ **Phase 0.5p-followup buildfix** (`phase-0.5p-followup-buildfix`, 2026-05-26) — Core scrubs (Notification.cs CustomDisplayPart removal, MyMessageBox.cs MyMessageBoxView removal, +System.Management package for WMI usage in Logger.cs/SerialPortProvider.cs), Astrometry DB-greenfield reconciliation (DatabaseInteraction.cs stubbed to GetUT1_UTC + GetDisplayAlias only; consumers AstroUtil.cs/TopocentricCoordinates.cs cleaned), Equipment vendor file deletions (EDCamera + MGENGuider + ASCOMInteraction + 4 flat device drivers + 3 orphaned test files), Phase 6 Alpaca discovery bug fix (`deviceType:` → `deviceTypes:` + missing `logger:` param). After this PR, `dotnet build OpenAstroAra.sln -c Release` is green except for the Sequencer item below.
- ✅ **Sequencer WPF-removal pass** — Resolved in Phase 0.5p2 (PR #242 / promoted #243). All 7 NINA-inherited projects (Core, Astrometry, Profile, Image, Equipment, PlateSolving, Sequencer) + Test now target `net10.0` headless per playbook §5.2/§8. WPF UI files deleted wholesale per §4.2 (~404 files); mediator-VM constraint dropped per §8.1; `BitmapSource` → `byte[]` for type signatures with OpenCvSharp4 wiring deferred per §line-2105; Compat stubs (`Astrometry/Compat/`, `Sequencer/Compat/`, `Image/ImageAnalysis/HeadlessStubs.cs`) preserve legacy call surfaces. `dotnet build OpenAstroAra.sln -c Release` → 0 errors, all CI matrix jobs green. Server csproj wired to all 7 libs in #244 / promoted #245 per playbook §8 Phase 4 scaffold.
- ✅ **NINA.Test.csproj post-Sequencer-removal** — Resolved alongside #242. Test subdirs that depended on deleted WPF/Sequencer code (Sequencer/, SimpleSequencer/, MGEN/, Plugin/, Converters/, ViewModel/, Autofocus/, FlatDevice/, Image/, PlateSolving/, Planetarium/, Focuser/, Rotator/, Dome/, Equipment/SDK/) purged per playbook §4.5. 296 platform-agnostic tests pass on macOS-arm64; 1006 NOVAS/SOFA fixtures filter to `[Platform("Win")]` since the natives are Windows-only Win32 binaries (libnovas.so + libsofa.so packaging is Phase 14e).

### Source-file `TODO(port)` markers

(none yet — Phase 0.5a is pure delete; no new code introduced)

## Out-of-scope CodeRabbit suggestions

- **PR #71** (port/ara → master promotion) — CR flagged `ExposureControlsPanel` for missing filter-slot control wired to `params.filterSlot` / `setFilterSlot`. This is a feature add (new UI control), not a bug fix; tracked here to land in a focused Phase 12c follow-up sub-PR alongside the rest of the exposure-controls editable wiring.

## CodeRabbit security findings addressed

- **PR #12** (port/ara → master promotion) — zizmor + CodeRabbit flagged `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for (1) mutable `actions/checkout@v4` reference, (2) missing `persist-credentials: false`. Both fixed on `ci-harden` branch. Future workflow steps added at Phase 0.5p / Phase 4 / Phase 11 / Phase 14 should follow the same pattern: actions pinned to a commit SHA + `persist-credentials: false` unless a step explicitly needs git push.

## Phase 15 sweep candidates

- ✅ **Consolidate `_SwitchRow` into shared editable-field widget set.** Resolved in PR #104 (Phase 12h.2-switch) — lifted into `lib/widgets/settings/editable_field.dart` as `SettingsSwitchRow` with optional `hint` slot. All 6 panel copies removed.
- ⏳ **Filename template `$$TOKEN$$` vs `$TOKEN$`.** All 4 sources of truth (WILMA `StorageSettings()` constructor, `ProfileApi` JSON fallback, `InMemoryProfileStore`, `FileProfileStore` `DefaultSnapshot`) currently use the double-dollar form. Sonnet flagged on PR #141 that NINA's filename-template render path likely expects single-dollar (`$TOKEN$`). Whether that's actually correct against the upstream NINA code is unverified — if so, a coordinated 4-file edit is needed in a follow-up PR. Same situation as the `\\` vs `\` separator question settled in PR #131 — consistency-across-defaults is fine for v0.0.1; semantic correctness against the rendering side needs a separate pass when the §29.2 rendering code lands.

## Phase 14 hardening candidates

- ✅ **Server AOT `JsonSerializerContext` source-gen.** **Resolved in Phase 14a** — single `AraJsonSerializerContext` partial class with `[JsonSerializable]` for all 133 DTO records + the 7 concrete `CursorPage<T>` instantiations + 8 `IReadOnlyList<T>` collection wrappers. Wired via `TypeInfoResolverChain.Insert(0, ...)` in `Program.cs`. `FileProfileStore.Persist`/`LoadOrDefaults` switched to typed-info overloads; pragmas removed. `dotnet run` smoke now passes end-to-end (verified: `/healthz` 200, GET/PUT `/api/v1/profile/imaging-defaults` round-trip, `profile.json` written to disk).
- ✅ **AOT-safe `JsonStringEnumConverter` per-enum.** Resolved in `phase-15-aot-enum-converters` — replaced the single non-generic `JsonStringEnumConverter(LowerCaseNamingPolicy)` with 8 per-enum `JsonStringEnumConverter<TEnum>(LowerCaseNamingPolicy.Instance)` registrations in `Program.cs`. Each generic instantiation is AOT-traceable; the `IL3050` suppression pragma is removed. .NET 10's `JsonStringEnumConverter<TEnum>` accepts a `JsonNamingPolicy` via its constructor — the earlier TODO assumed that constructor didn't exist.
