# OpenAstro Ara — API contract design log

Append-only design log for the server↔client REST + WebSocket API. One entry per endpoint or wire-shape decision.

Per PORT_PLAYBOOK.md §1: created Phase 0.5 (this file), populated starting Phase 5 (API contract definition) per §9.

The source-of-truth contract itself lives in `OpenAstroAra.Server/openapi.yaml` (Phase 5+). This file captures the *reasoning* behind each contract decision — DTO shapes, idempotency choices, WebSocket event taxonomy, error-shape conventions — for future contributors who need to understand "why does endpoint X look like this."

---

## Phase 5 (not yet started)

Awaiting Phase 5. Entries will follow this template:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

**Endpoint(s) or area:** `POST /api/v1/...`

**Decision:** <what was decided>

**Reasoning:** <why; alternatives considered>

**Spec ref:** `OpenAstroAra.Server/openapi.yaml#/paths/...`

**Related:** §X.Y of PORT_PLAYBOOK.md, PR #N
```
